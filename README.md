# Decoding Ocular Dominance Columns for Double-Drift Stimulus

The [double-drift stimulus](https://cavlab.net/Demos/DoubleDrift/) (Saleki et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2019; 
Lisi and Cavanagh, 2015) presents an illusory shift in location due to conflicting local and global motion signals. 
In this experiment, we aim to find whether top-down attentional signals target the physical or the perceived path of
this stimulus in V1. This repository contains code for the behavioral experiment and its data, 3T fMRI scanning, 
and the analysis. Functional MRI data can be found [here](!oops). 

## Pre-scan Behavioral Experiment

We use this experiment to determine the illusory deviation of the stimulus with selected parameters. Participants
view the double-drift move up its path in the periphery for 1s, and move down to its original location for 1s. The 
stimulus is located 7 dva to the left or right of the fixation (hemisphere locations randomized trial-by-trial). Three
sets of parameters (internal and external speeds: [], [], and []) are pre-selected and presented each for 10 trials on
each side of the display.
